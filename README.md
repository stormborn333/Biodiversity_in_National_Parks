# Biodiversity in National Parks
In this project I wanted to praciste my Data Analyst skills, mostly Python(pandas,numpy) and data visualisation(matplotlib,seaborn). The goal of this project was to analyze 2 files that toghether contain data about 4 National Park in United States.
I wanted to check which parks have the most number of animals and plants observations. This project is a part of my Data Scientist Carrer Path course on Codecademy.
